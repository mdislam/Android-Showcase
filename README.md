# Android-Showcase
This is a fun project where I will try to build a showcase of Android stuffs which includes UI components, network functionality, common helper class. Basically I will organize here different android stuffs which I have learnt so far. I will also organize a wiki to describe 'how-to' and write some best practices from my point of view. Enjoy Androing!
